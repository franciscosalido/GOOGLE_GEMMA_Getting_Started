In the code above, the string `\"gemma_2b_en\"` specifies the preset architecture: a Gemma model with 2 billion parameters. (A Gemma model with 7 billion parameters is also available. To run the larger model in Colab, you need access to the premium GPUs available in paid plans. Alternatively, you can perform [distributed tuning on a Gemma 7B model](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/distributed_tuning) on Kaggle or Google Cloud.)\n",
